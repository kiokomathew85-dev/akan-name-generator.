# Akan Name Generator

## Project Description
The Akan Name Generator is a simple web application that calculates the day of the week a user was born based on their birthdate and assigns them an Akan name according to their gender. Akan names originate from Ghanaian culture, where children are traditionally named after the day of the week they were born.

This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript functions, arrays, control flow, user input validation, and basic web development concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
